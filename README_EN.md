X-Meta engine
======
X-meta is a Java engine for dynamic models. Dynamic model is an object-oriented programming method that uses structured data such as XML to program.

Dynamic Model
======
Dynamic model comes from framework programming, which tends to use framework configuration file to program, thus evolving a programming method based on configuration model.

Object-oriented
======
The dynamic model realizes object-oriented, and its characteristics are as follows:
- An XML and every node of an XML are treated as an independent model.
- Classes, objects, methods, and so on are represented using models.
- The model is interpreted and executed by the engine.
- The model is data, which can be modified at run time, so the classes and behaviors of objects are dynamically variable, and the dynamic model can realize dynamic programming at run time.

Development platform and model library
======
Xworker is the development platform and application platform of dynamic model. Xworker has written many models and accumulated various applications written or encapsulated with models.
